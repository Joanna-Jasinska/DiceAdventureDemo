So their home is a caravan constantly moving towards neverchanging direction.
To live they pull resources from nearby locations using force and bargaining.
You are one of the few Rajavi elite Pathforcers.
Your task is to make sure nothing stands on the way of Rajavi caravan on their way to salvation.
