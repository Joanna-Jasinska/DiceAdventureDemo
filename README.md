# DiceAdventureDemo

Work in progress.

Planing to make proper step-by-step "playable" tutorial in future 
(for now there is tutorial in game but in a form of long page to read, sorry)

Purpose of this rushed project was to not show agile delivery but to make as many features as possible in short time to see how more or less the game would play out formed from a rough design idea - and to simplify it and add quality of life improvemens later.
Long story short i just wanted to play it and see how much i could do within a limited time.
